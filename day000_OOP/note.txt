🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
1️⃣ Class
A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines what data and actions an object will have.
📌 Example: A Car class defines color, model, and speed.
2️⃣ Object
An object is a real-world instance of a class. It represents an actual entity created from the class.
📌 Example: MyCar is an object of the Car class.
3️⃣ Encapsulation
Encapsulation means binding data and methods together and protecting data from outside access.
📌 It improves security and data control.
4️⃣ Abstraction
Abstraction shows only important details and hides unnecessary information.
📌 Example: You use a car without knowing how the engine works.
5️⃣ Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to reuse the properties of another class.
📌 It helps reduce code duplication.
6️⃣ Polymorphism
Polymorphism means one name, many forms. The same method behaves differently in different situations.
📌 Example: A draw() method works differently for a circle and a square.
